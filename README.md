# MyLinuxConf

I use mostly the same applications on Linux Terminal sessions. But I get fed up copying my preferences. Then I
decided to build this github deposit. It includes a setup script to install everything properly.

The tools I use are:

 - Zsh  : What a nice and wonderfull Shell,
 - TMux : Very good linux session multiplexor,
 - Vim  : THE editor :)

ZSH:

IMPORTANT: zsh has to be installed on your system (via sudo apt-get install zsh on Ubuntu).

First of all, I'm using the zsh shell. But because I'm working on MS Windows, the configuration folder is zsh (.zsh is refused).
Then, my setup.sh script is renaming it to '.zsh'.

This folder contains all zsh configuration files. At the moment, only .zshrc is populated with the main configuration file. It will also
contain my history and extra zsh stuff.

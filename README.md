# MyLinuxConf

I use mostly the same applications on Linux Terminal sessions. But I get fed up copying my preferences. Then I
decided to build this github deposit. It includes a setup script to install everything properly.

The tools I use are:

 - Zsh  : What a nice and wonderfull Shell,
 - TMux : Very good linux session multiplexor,
 - Vim  : THE editor :)
